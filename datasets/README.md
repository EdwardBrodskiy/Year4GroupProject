### Raw
The original data collected *as-is* from source.

### Cleaned
The dataset after it's been cleaned, e.g. normalised image scale, resolution, etc.

#### non-fire

The dataset contains images of different forest terrains, e.g. grass lands or fields, and close-up shots of lake areas as forests might include reservoirs or dams. Not all are cloud-free.
